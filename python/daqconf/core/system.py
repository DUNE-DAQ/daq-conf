class System:
    """
    A full DAQ system consisting of multiple applications and the
    connections between them. The `apps` member is a dictionary from
    application name to app object, and the app_connections member is
    a dictionary from upstream endpoint to publisher or sender object
    representing the downstream endpoint(s). Endpoints are specified
    as strings like app_name.endpoint_name.

    An explicit mapping from upstream endpoint name to zeromq
    connection string may be specified, but typical usage is to not
    specify this, and leave the mapping to be automatically generated.

    The same is true for application start order.
