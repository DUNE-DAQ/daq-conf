# daqconf

This repository contains tools for generating DAQ system configurations, the [`daqconf_multiru_gen` script](../scripts/daqconf_multiru_gen) ("DAQ configuration, multiple readout unit generator") and [`daqconf_global_gen` script](../scripts/daqconf_global_gen) ("DAQ configuration, global generator"). They generate DAQ system configurations with different characteristics based on command-line parameters that are given to the script. 

The focus of this documentation is on providing instructions for using the tools and running sample DAQ systems. If you're starting out, take a look at:

[Instructions for casual or first-time users](InstructionsForCasualUsers.md)

and for a slightly more in-depth look into how to generate configurations for a DAQ system, take a look at:

[Configuration options for casual or first-time users](ConfigurationsForCasualUsers.md)

For a nice visual representation of the type of DAQ system which can be configured, take a look at the [daqconf Diagram](daqconf-Diagrams.md)
