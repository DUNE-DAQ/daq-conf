This repository has tools for generating DAQ system configurations. At the moment, these tools consist of a single Python script that generates DAQ system configurations with different characteristics based on command-line parameters that are given to the script.  This script is daq-conf/python/daq-conf/newconf/mdapp_multiru_gen.py.  

The focus of this documentation is on providing instructions for using the tools and running sample DAQ systems.
